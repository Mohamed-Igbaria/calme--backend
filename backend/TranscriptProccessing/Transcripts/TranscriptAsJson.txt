      "text": "It's understandable. Therapy is a new concept for many, but most people find it a safe and comfortable space. I had a professor once tell me that therapy is unique. It's two people focusing on one person, and it's the only relationship where that happens. I don't have to worry about you; I can focus all my attention on you. I hope you can allow that and benefit from this time together."

      "speaker": "Khalid",
      "text": "Absolutely. The idea of focusing on one reminds me of my time at King Faisal Specialist Hospital. When I was performing surgeries, the entire team was focused on that one patient, working together for their well-being."

      "text": "King Faisal Specialist Hospital is renowned for cardiothoracic surgery. I was there for 17 years and served as chief of staff. Have you ever held someone's life in your hands, knowing you have the power of life and death? That's what cardiac surgery is like. I had a young woman, Amira, who was in perfect health. She died on the operating table. There was no explanation. I did everything right, but she passed away. Her family was understanding, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I had failed. After that, I needed a change. The opportunity at the Saudi German Hospital arose, and my wife and I discussed it. Her family is in Jeddah, and family is important to her. I understand that, but it wasn't as important to me. We moved to Jeddah, and that's why I'm here."

      "speaker": "Khalid",
      "text": "It's easy to bring up the pain. I still carry it with me. I did everything I could for her, but I failed. There was no excuse. I pride myself on my work, my professionalism, and my team's dedication. Our core purpose is to save lives. I know many others have had successful outcomes under my care, but that doesn't erase this. It haunts me."

      "timestamp": "0:05:53",
      "speaker": "Khalid",
      "text": "No, I don't. A big part of my job as an educator is to instill confidence in them. A cardiothoracic surgeon who lacks confidence is a detriment to themselves, their team, and their patients. I want them to focus on their skills and knowledge, not on my personal experiences. They'll learn those lessons on their own."

      "speaker": "Khalid",
      "text": "When I failed Amira, I felt like I had failed myself. I vowed to become a heart surgeon when my father died. I wanted to save others from suffering a similar fate. I was with my friend, Abdullah, when my father collapsed. I tried CPR, called an ambulance, but he didn't survive. That's when I decided to pursue medicine. So, when I lost Amira, it felt like I had lost my father again. I know it might sound obsessive, but it's there. It's something I can't just shake off. As for leaving the hospital, I lost faith in my colleagues. I was the leader, and it felt like I had passed my prime."

      "text": "I was supposed to join the family business, but my brother took over. I went to school and became a surgeon. It wasn't easy, but I was focused. I went to the University of Pennsylvania. Perfectionism is key in this field. Surgeons often come across as arrogant because they are so confident. They are intelligent, dedicated, and hardworking. You have to be focused throughout your medical career."

Your wife is unhappy, your children feel distant, and you've had heart palpitations. Your cardiologist suggested you come here. What would you like to focus on? What's important to you right now?"

I'm always tired when I'm home, and my wife and I haven't been intimate in about a year. She's been encouraging me to go to counseling. I might consider it after our sessions. I don't want to be foolish and ignore the situation. My brother, Faisal, is also going through a tough time. He mentioned that he might benefit from therapy after I told him about mine. Would you be interested in talking to him?"

      "text": "I'm hearing two themes in your story, Khalid. One is your dedication to work. You pour your heart and soul into it, driven by past traumas. The other theme is loneliness and disconnection in your relationships. People want to be close to you, but there's a barrier. How do you balance these two aspects of your life?"

I don't want to dwell on the negative, but my wife says I shouldn't be thinking about it. Occasionally, I have vivid dreams about that situation. It happens two or three times a year. It's deeply embedded. I can picture myself, the room, my team, and then the flatline."

We can help you find peace with what happened in the operating room and with your father's death. Many people don't understand how devastating that was for you as a young man. Healing from these traumas is essential for shifting your work-life balance. It's not just about wanting recognition or fame; it's about working through these deep-seated issues. By addressing these traumas, you might be able to rebalance your life. Does that make sense?"
